## Brief explanation:
API throttling is the practice of slowing down API calls to prevent the overload of your servers or other systems. This can be done manually by taking the server offline or by inserting a delay in the API call to prevent the overloading of your servers or other systems. Thus, API throttling is implemented directly on the server side using a language such as Java, Ruby, or Python.

On the other hand, rate limiting is done on a user or client level. And although it does offer more granular control over the API’s usage access, it is harder to implement when treating the problem as a server-level problem.

## GPT explanation:
Request throttling and rate limiting are terms often used interchangeably because they both serve a similar purpose—to control the amount of traffic a server accepts to maintain performance and prevent abuse. However, they can imply slightly different approaches or mechanisms in how this control is implemented.

### Request Throttling
Throttling generally refers to the process of regulating the rate at which individual endpoints can handle requests. This can be visualized as narrowing the pipe through which the requests flow. Throttling is primarily used to ensure that a server or service does not get overwhelmed by too many requests at once, which could degrade performance for all users.

- **Use Case Focus:** Throttling is often applied dynamically based on current server load. If the server starts to experience high load, it might begin throttling incoming requests to stabilize performance.
- **Method:** It might slow down the response rate, essentially "throttling" the speed at which responses are sent. For instance, if a user is making too many requests too quickly, throttling might delay subsequent responses to that user for a certain period.

### Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is a more specific form of throttling that involves setting explicit limits on the number of requests that can be made to a server or API within a specific time frame (e.g., 100 requests per minute). Once a user hits this limit, they are blocked from making further requests until the limit resets.

- **Use Case Focus:** Rate limiting is used to enforce a consistent, predictable rule of access, ensuring fair usage and preventing abuse of the service.
- **Method:** Rate limiting strictly enforces the number of requests in a given time period without necessarily considering the server's current load. It’s more about maintaining equitable access and preventing excessive use than responding to current conditions.

### Key Differences
1. **Objective:**
   - **Throttling:** Aims to regulate request speed and server load dynamically. It can adjust in real-time to current server conditions.
   - **Rate Limiting:** Aims to cap the number of requests a user can send to a server in a specified time window, regardless of server condition.

2. **Implementation:**
   - **Throttling:** Can be variable based on conditions. For example, a server might only start throttling when the load reaches a certain threshold.
   - **Rate Limiting:** Is usually fixed to specific limits per user or IP address and resets in a rolling window or a fixed reset time.

3. **Feedback to User:**
   - **Throttling:** Might not always inform the user explicitly unless the server is unable to handle requests at all.
   - **Rate Limiting:** Typically sends a clear response, such as HTTP 429 Too Many Requests, informing users that they have hit a predefined limit.

4. **Control Mechanism:**
   - **Throttling:** May involve delaying responses or slowly "drip-feeding" the data to the user.
   - **Rate Limiting:** Blocks additional requests once the limit is reached until the time window resets.

Both mechanisms are vital for API management and ensuring that web services can scale while providing reliable and fair access to users. They help maintain the quality of service, prevent abuse, and ensure that resources are available for all users in a controlled manner.
